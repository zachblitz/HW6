## As usual, this HW is worth 500 points in total.
## There are 10 problems. Each one is worth 50 points.

## There are tests for each problem; you should also follow the instructions for things to do in the code that cannot be tested with unit tests, e.g. using certain structures.


## [PROBLEM 1]
print("\n\n***** Problem 1 *****")
## We've provided a definition of a class Student, similar to the one you may have seen in lecture. 
## Add a method to class Student called write_programs which accepts one optional parameter with a default value of 1, and adds the input integer to the self.num_programs instance variable.

class Student():
    def __init__(self, name, years_at_umich=1, programs_written=0):
        self.name = name
        self.years_UM = years_at_umich
        self.bonus_points = random.randrange(1000)
        self.num_programs = programs_written

    def shout(self, phrase_to_shout):
        print(phrase_to_shout)  # print is for ppl!

    def __str__(self):
        return "My name is {}, and I've been at UMich for about {} years. I got {} bonus_points and I have written {} programs while here.".format(self.name, self.years_UM, self.bonus_points, self.num_programs)

    def year_at_umich(self):
        return this_Student.years_UM

    # Define the additional method here
    def write_programs(self, programs = 1):
        self.num_programs += programs

    def method_for_productivity(self):
        productivity = self.num_programs / self.years_UM
        return(productivity)

#### DONE WITH STUDENT CLASS DEFINITION

    
print("===========")
## Code to show how this works...s
pst = Student("Jay", 3, 2)
print(pst)  # This should print: My name is Jay, and I've been at UMich for about 3 years. I got <some number 0-1000> of bonus points and I have written 2 programs while here.
pst.shout("I'm doing awesome on this problem set.")  # This should print: I'm doing awesome on this problem set.

## Feel free to add more testing code here to help you understand the class definition, especially to try out your write_programs method...


print("===========")

## [PROBLEM 2]
print("\n\n***** Problem 2 *****")

## Define a function called personal_map. This function should do a very similar thing to the Python built-in map function.
## It should take as input one function object (required), and one list (required), in that order.
## The function should invoke the input function upon each element of the input list, and accumulate the return values to a new list.
## The function should return the new list of accumulated -- mapped! -- values.
## HINT: you should be able to write this in 5 lines of code or fewer! 

def personal_map(func_obj, list_obj):

    my_list = []
    for x in list_obj:
        my_list.append(func_obj(x))

    return(my_list)




## [PROBLEM 3]
print("\n\n***** Problem 3 *****")

## We've provided the function access_third_elem. Write a lambda function that does exactly the same thing as access_third_elem (you can assume any input it would receive has at least 3 elements in it). Assign that lambda function to the variable sample_func.

## Note that we cannot specifically test in the unit tests whether it is a lambda function, but you will not get points for this question unless it is.

## Provided, do not change:
def access_third_elem(seq):
    return seq[2]
## End

# Write your equivalent function and assignment statement here
sample_func = (lambda seq: seq[2])

## [PROBLEM 4]
print("\n\n***** Problem 4 *****")

## Provided code
names = ["Albert", "Bisi", "Mai", "Dinesh", "Euijin"]
seniority = [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]
programs_written = [10, 500, 20, 131, 46]
## End provided code

# Given that provided code, write one line of code to create a zip iterator instance saved in a variable called student_tups, here:
student_tups = zip(names, seniority, programs_written)

# Then write a line of code to cast the iterator to a list (it should end up as a list of tuples). Save that list in a variable called student_tups_list.
student_tups_list = list(student_tups)

## You can test this out with any code you like here, and similar below other problems, but make sure to comment out any code that uses up the iterator in order to pass the tests!
    


## [PROBLEM 5]
print("\n\n***** Problem 5 *****")
# Use a list comprehension to create a list of Student instances out of the student_tups list you just created in Problem 2, and save that list in a variable called programmers. You should make sure you pass these tests before continuing, as you'll need this list for problems later on!
programmers = [Student(a,b,c) for a,b,c in student_tups_list]


## [PROBLEM 6]
print("\n\n***** Problem 6 *****")

# A Student's programming_productivity is defined as that student's number of programs written divided by the years they have been at UMich.

# Use the Python map function on the programmers list you just created, in order to create an map instance iterator of numbers representing the productivity of each student. Save the map iterator in a variable called prod_iter.

## Write code to cast that iterator to a list. Save that list in the variable prod_list.

## You may add a method to the Student class if you wish in order to do this, but you do not need to. (If you do, make sure you do not create any syntax errors that keep code/tests from running!)
prod_iter = map(lambda student: student.num_programs / student.years_UM, programmers)

prod_list = list(prod_iter)
## [PROBLEM 7]
print("\n\n***** Problem 7 *****")
# Create a list of tuples wherein each tuple has a student's name and productivity value. Save the list of tuples in a variable called names_and_productivities. To do this, you should use a list comprehension (you may also use the zip function, and you may use any variables you have already created).

## But be careful that if you use answers from previous problems, you use the LISTs you generated, so that all your tests can still pass and you avoid confusion!

names_and_productivities_iter = [tup for tup in zip(names, prod_list)]
names_and_productivities = list(names_and_productivities_iter)

## [PROBLEM 8]
print("\n\n***** Problem 8 *****")
# Use the Python filter function to select the subset of programmers who have names with 5 or more characters. (i.e. ["Albert","Dinesh","Euijin"]) Your result should be an filter object that points to Student instances. Save that filter iterator in a variable called long_names.
long_names = filter(lambda student: len(student.name) >= 5, programmers)


## Then write code to cast the value of long_names to a list and save it in the variable long_names_list. 

long_names_list = list(long_names)

## [PROBLEM 9]
print("\n\n***** Problem 9 *****")

# Use a list comprehension to generate a LIST of just the names of those Student instances whose name is longer than their seniority (i.e., ["Albert", "Mai", "Dinesh", "Euijin"]). Assign it to a variable called names_with_not_too_much_seniority.

## Note that you can use another list you have already created for this problem.

names_with_not_too_much_seniority = [student.name for student in programmers if len(student.name) > student.years_UM]



## [PROBLEM 10]
print("\n\n***** Problem 10 *****")

## Define a function called readfiles, which accepts a list of filenames as input and yields each line in each of the file with that name, assuming those files exist in the same directory as this program.

## Define a generator called len_check which accepts a generator of file lines and returns a generator object of all the lines it's accepted whose length is longer than 40 characters.

## Finally, write a function called main_filterer that accepts a list of filenames (strings), and returns a generator of all the lines in those files that are longer than 40 characters. The function should invoke the other function and generator, readfiles and len_check.

## There is a test for this but an even more fun test is to uncomment the code below which invokes the main_filterer function and prints each line from the generator without blank lines in between (that's what the comma is doing).

## The examples here http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/iterators.html in your reading may be very helpful!

## We have provided files samplehw6_1.txt and samplehw6_2.txt for your use for this problem, which hopefully you have downloaded, so you can test with those file names! The test below also relies upon these files. Of course, you could also create other files for testing.

# Define readfiles (make sure to close the file reference in the right place)
def readfiles(list_fnames):
    for file in list_fnames:
        open_file = open(file, "r")
        for line in open_file:
            yield line
        open_file.close()

# Define len_check
def len_check(lines):
    for line in lines:
        if (len(line) > 40):
            yield line

# Define main_filterer
def main_filterer(names):
    lines_to_check = readfiles(names)
    long_lines = len_check(lines_to_check)
    return long_lines


## Uncomment this code to test so you can see easily what results from your code. DO uncomment it. DO NOT delete or change it. (You can add other code above while you work, of course.)
# provided_file_names = ["samplehw6_1.txt","samplehw6_2.txt"]
# for ln in main_filterer(provided_file_names):
#     print(ln.rstrip('\n'), end=" ")
